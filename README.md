# Mobile Phone Price Prediction with Feature Extraction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting mobile phone prices based on key features.

By understanding the features that most influence price, we can assist a prominent mobile phone seller in refining their pricing strategy.

## Project Goals:

Build a predictive model to estimate mobile phone prices.

Identify the most influential features affecting price through feature extraction.

Recommend impactful features for informed pricing and marketing decisions.

## Data:

The provided dataset contains detailed information on various mobile phones, including:

Model, Color

Memory, RAM, Battery Capacity

Rear/Front Camera Specs

AI Lens Presence, Mobile Height

Processor

Price (target variable)

## Methodology:

### Data Exploration:

Analyze dataset structure, data types, and feature value ranges.

### Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding).

### Feature Extraction:

Identify highly impactful features using:

Statistical methods (correlation analysis)

Feature importance techniques (selection or dimensionality reduction)

### Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Develop a machine learning model for price prediction (using linear regression, random forests).

### Model Evaluation:

Assess model performance using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

### Feature Importance Analysis:

Validate feature importance identified during extraction using model insights.

### Reporting & Visualization:

Comprehensive report with visualizations summarizing key findings are derived to show the client.

## Outcomes:

A well-performing model for mobile phone price prediction.

Identification of the most influential features affecting mobile phone prices.

Actionable recommendations for optimizing pricing and marketing strategies based on feature importance.

## Tools and Libraries:

This project involves employing:

Machine learning libraries (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)

Data visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Data analysis techniques (correlation, feature selection)
