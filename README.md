# Mobile Phone Price Prediction with Feature Extraction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting mobile phone prices based on key features.
By understanding the features that most influence price, we can assist a prominent mobile phone seller in refining their pricing strategy.

## Project Goals:

Build a predictive model to estimate mobile phone prices.

Identify the most influential features affecting price through feature extraction.

Recommend impactful features for informed pricing and marketing decisions.

## Data:

The provided dataset contains detailed information on various mobile phones, including:

Model, Color

Memory, RAM, Battery Capacity

Rear/Front Camera Specs

AI Lens Presence, Mobile Height

Processor
Price (target variable)
Methodology:

Data Exploration:

Analyze dataset structure, data types, and feature value ranges.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Feature Extraction:

Identify highly impactful features using:
Statistical methods (correlation analysis)
Feature importance techniques (selection or dimensionality reduction)
Visualizations
Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Develop a machine learning model for price prediction (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting).
Model Evaluation:

Assess model performance using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
Feature Importance Analysis:

Validate feature importance identified during extraction using model insights.
Reporting & Visualization:

Generate a comprehensive report with visualizations summarizing key findings.
Outcomes:

A well-performing model for mobile phone price prediction.
Identification of the most influential features affecting mobile phone prices.
Actionable recommendations for optimizing pricing and marketing strategies based on feature importance.
Technical Skills:

This project involves employing:

Machine learning libraries (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
Data visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Data analysis techniques (correlation, feature selection)
Benefits:

This project empowers the mobile phone seller with data-driven insights to:

Set competitive and informed prices.
Target marketing efforts based on impactful features.
This project sets the stage for further exploration into advanced models and market dynamics, ultimately guiding a data-centric approach to mobile phone sales.
